# Progress Tracker

## Current Phase

GitHub issue planning is complete. The production website build is ready to move into foundation implementation and parallel section work.

## Completed

- Created active brand guidance in `skills/BRAND.md`.
- Created active design-system guidance in `skills/DESIGN.md`.
- Defined primary, secondary, neutral, extended, gradient, typography, spacing, radius, button, and shader guidance in the active design system.
- Created Figma button component variants for `Primary`, `Outline`, `Secondary`, and `Ghost`, with `Default` and `lg` sizes plus `Default`, `Hover`, and `Disabled` states.
- Clarified that shader recipes lock colors only; motion uniforms are tuned in code.
- Created this `skills/context/` folder for agent implementation context.
- Added root `AGENTS.md` to point agents to the required read order.
- Clarified documentation ownership so `BRAND.md` owns brand guidance, `DESIGN.md` owns design-system contracts, and `skills/context/` owns website implementation context.
- Mapped Cortex design tokens into `src/app/globals.css` with CSS custom properties and Tailwind 4 `@theme inline`.
- Converted reusable gradient CSS variables to stop-list tokens so horizontal and vertical usage can set direction locally.
- Set the default section container contract to Tailwind default breakpoints through a named `.site-container` class.
- Added a separate `CortexButton` wrapper in `src/components/` that extends the shadcn `Button` with Cortex token variants and placed primary/outline CTA examples on the homepage.
- Preserved `CortexButton` typography through `tailwind-merge` by using token-backed arbitrary size and line-height utilities.
- Set Service Cards as the canonical reusable card terminology across design, brand, and implementation context docs.
- Services section uses **five Service Cards** (one per service in Figma cortex-web, May 2026), not three. Any older notes referring to three should be ignored. The cards each compose `<ServiceVisualSurface variant="service-...">` from the F6 WebGL visual runtime; placement is owned by `services-section.tsx`.
- Set a GSAP-first scroll and motion runtime: `gsap`, `@gsap/react`, ScrollTrigger, and optional ScrollSmoother.
- ScrollSmoother is not part of v1; use normal browser scrolling for launch and revisit global smooth scrolling after launch if the site needs it.
- Cleaned self-animated SVG pattern rules into runnable starter-kit examples under `skills/examples/`.
- Added five algorithmic Pattern Studio animated SVG starters and temporary homepage demos: Pulse Field, Dot Orbits, Radiating Segments, Stepped Lattice, and Node Mesh. The examples now generate geometry in code and include targeted performance refinements where needed.
- Condensed `skills/context/ui-context.md` animation guidance so detailed per-pattern contracts live in `skills/examples/`.
- Clarified that production Mission animated SVGs live inside `MissionCard` and only run while their card is active.
- Created the v1 GitHub issue set for foundations, section features, polish, launch, post-launch, and remaining decisions.
- Updated GitHub CI workflow to use Bun setup, frozen lockfile install, lint, typecheck, and build commands.

## Decisions

- `skills/DESIGN.md` defines the design system.
- `skills/BRAND.md` defines brand voice, naming, logo rules, and non-UI asset behavior.
- `skills/context/` defines implementation context: product, architecture, UI mapping, code standards, workflow, and progress.
- Tailwind 4 and shadcn/ui should be used for the production website.
- Bun is the default package manager and script runner for the production website.
- GSAP, `@gsap/react`, ScrollTrigger, and optional ScrollSmoother should be used for coordinated website UI animation and scroll-linked motion.
- Do not add a separate smooth-scroll dependency by default; use ScrollSmoother only if the website needs a global polished scroll layer.
- All five Pattern Studio starters (Pulse Field, Dot Orbits, Radiating Segments, Stepped Lattice, Node Mesh) use algorithmic SVG generation with no static SVG file dependencies. This is the standard approach: generate geometry in code and animate with GSAP.
- `skills/examples/` can be imported by temporary demo pages as a starter kit; production sections should adapt examples into `src/components/`.
- React Three Fiber, @react-three/drei, and Three.js should be used for shader or 3D moments when real runtime rendering is necaeded.
- Files and folders should use kebab-case; React component exports can stay PascalCase.
- Design tokens should map through `src/app/globals.css` and Tailwind 4 `@theme inline`, then components should use semantic Tailwind utilities directly or compose reusable named classes in `@layer components` with `@apply`, like `.site-container`, rather than raw hex values or a default `lib/design-tokens.ts` file.
- shadcn is used as a component API/accessibility base, not as a visual source to copy blindly.
- Layout should be responsive and token-driven, not hardcoded from a 1440px mockup.
- Reusable gradient CSS variables should store color stops, while `linear-gradient()` direction should be composed at the usage site unless direction is itself a design-system contract.
- Standard page sections should use `.site-container` before introducing custom layout tokens or breakpoints.
- `.site-container` uses Tailwind `@apply mx-auto w-full max-w-7xl px-5 sm:px-8 lg:px-12`.
- The app root loads Mona Sans and Open Sans once with `next/font/google`; Tailwind font utilities expose `font-mona` and `font-open`.
- `src/components/ui/` is reserved for generated shadcn/ui components; custom Cortex components and wrappers live in `src/components/` outside `ui/`.
- Service Cards are the canonical name for shader-backed service surfaces; future section code should use `services-section.tsx`.

## Open Questions

## Next Steps

1. Hero section.
2. Footer shell.
3. Section work in parallel once blocking foundation issues are available.

## Latest Handoff

- Changed: moved reusable site header, desktop mega nav, and mobile nav visual contracts into `src/app/globals.css` as CSS variables and `@layer components` classes, then replaced hard-to-read raw Tailwind values in the header/nav components with named classes. Set the mobile nav panel to intentionally fill the viewport width while keeping its background pinned to pure Cortex Carbon. Rolled back the experimental mobile CTA arrow animation; the arrow is static again. Softened the shared button text hover turnover angle while preserving the original slide-text structure. Replaced header logo `<img>` tags with inline `CortexMark` and `CortexWordmark` SVG components that use `currentColor`, so logo colors are controlled through Tailwind utilities instead of hardcoded SVG fills.
- Files touched: `src/app/globals.css`, `src/components/layout/site-header.tsx`, `src/components/layout/mobile-nav.tsx`, `src/components/logos/cortex-mark.tsx`, `src/components/logos/cortex-wordmark.tsx`, `skills/context/progress-tracker.md`.
- Verification run: `bun run lint`; `bun run build`; browser check on `http://localhost:3000` confirmed `.mobile-nav-panel` CSS includes full-width and Cortex Carbon overrides.
- Open questions: none.
- Next step: continue foundation implementation with the same semantic token pattern before section work expands.
